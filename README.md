#### Introduction
**Asset Management/Life-Cycle** 

This will consist of managing devices such as organizational computers, printers, and business cellphones by annotating the devices serial number, model number, current OS, and in some cases their purpose. Most devices will need to go through a life-cycle management process due to the constant upgrade of technology and software updates (to include OS) associated with old and new devices.

This website will allow a designated person within an IT department identify all the IT requirements to include hardware and software for that sector of that organization (if there are other branches), lists the assets that can meet the requirements, and pinpoint where there are shortages. From there, the person in charge of managing this data would go through that companies ordering process to ensure devices are maintain and life cycled in the appropriate time.
Things that will be included in this website;
+	Definitely a home page displaying a description of the website’s functionality.
+	Reports for equipment, costs, authorizations, and department specific.
+	A user manual that will support the companies purchasing policy, and how to utilize the website.
+	Records of each section/departments equipment that mentions the location and port connection if applicable.
+	A search bar that will allow you to search equipment within the organization.
+	Various roles to manage each branch’s administrative rights (Developer, Administrator, Chief Integration Officer, Integration Management Officer, Approver, and Jr Integration Manager).
